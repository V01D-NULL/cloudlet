# API Routes by service

API url: http://localhost:8888

Docker machines are unreachable from the host or any machine on the network. They can, however communicate with the outside world if the network attached to a container is public.

That being said, all traffic must be routed through the api, endpoints are as follows:

[net](./services/net.md)
[ct-launch](./services/ct-launch.md)
